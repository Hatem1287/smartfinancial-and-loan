In many places, these minimums include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bodily Injury Liability:</strong> This coverage pays for injuries to others when you are at fault in an accident.</li>
<li><strong>Property Damage Liability:</strong> This covers damages to someone else's property, like their vehicle or a fence, that occur due to your driving.</li>
<li><strong>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage:</strong> This protects you if you're involved in an accident with a driver who doesn’t have enough insurance.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Injury Protection (PIP):</strong> Required in some states, PIP covers medical expenses for you and your passengers, regardless of fault.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you are aware of your state’s particular requirements. You can easily find this information online or by contacting local car insurance companies for guidance.

Commonly available options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:</strong> This pays for damages to your vehicle from non-collision incidents, such as theft, vandalism, or natural disasters.</li>
<li><strong>Collision Coverage:</strong> This covers damages to your vehicle from accidents with other vehicles or objects, regardless of fault.</li>
<li><strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> This feature can help you in situations like flat tires, battery jumps, or being locked out of your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Rental Car Reimbursement:</strong> If your car is in the shop after an accident, this coverage helps pay for a rental car.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider which of these options makes sense for your situation. If you live in an area with high levels of theft or accidents, comprehensive and collision coverage might be worth the extra cost. On the other hand, if you have an older car, you might find that only carrying the state’s minimum liabilities is sufficient.</p>
